# About
Our project is a platform that lists verified and healthy pets for adoption.
The program will act as a pet adoption site in which users are able to scroll through pets that are up for adoption.
Users looking to use_case.adopt are able to view all pets currently available for adoption.
Each user will be prompted to make a profile with their unique identification on the webpage,
which they have to sign in to view the listed pets.
Additionally, users can set preferences on their profile page and use those preferences as a filter in the search.
The preference profile will include questions regarding the preferred pet type (cat for now), size, age, and
personality to help find the perfect fit for the pet and the new owner.

* This project was entirely written in Java.
* Java Swing was used for the GUI.
